Challenege 3 Part 2: Making ISA Coverage 100% for RV32i 

in this challenge we are supposed to generate the random tests with help of pygen and run coverage merging script and make coverage 100% for RV32I ISA.

To get coverage 100% we should run all Valid RV32I instructions, we dont realy have covergroup information on how coverage is coded so its little difficult to generate the tests becuase there will be some cross bins or temporal bins and for that we should know the component bins used.
